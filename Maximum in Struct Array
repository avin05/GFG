Given a struct array of type Height, having two elements feet and inches. Find the maximum height, where height is calculated sum of feet and inches after converting feet into inches.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases. For each testcase, first line of input contains N, number of given heights. Next line contains 2*N number of elements (feet and inches for each N).

Output:
Output maximum height from array.

Your Task: Your task is to only complete the function of find maximum height from given array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=105
0<=Feet, Inches<=105

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 2 1
4
3 5 7 9 5 6 5 5
Output:
25
93

Explanation:
Testcase 1: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are respective given heights. After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 14 and 25 as respective heights. So, 25 is the maximum height.

CODE:


/*Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function is mentioned above.*/

/*
Class of the element of the array is as
class Height {
	int feet;
	int inches;
	public Height(int ft, int inc)
	{
	    feet = ft;
	    inches = inc;
	}
}
*/
// function must return the maximum Height
// return the height in inches
class GfG
{
    public static int findMax(Height arr[], int n)
    {  int i,j,max=0;
       int narr[]=new int[n];
       for(i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
           narr[i]=arr[i].feet*12+arr[i].inches;
           
       }
      
       
        for(j=0;j<n;j++)
           {
            if(narr[j]>max)
               {
                   max=narr[j];
               }
        
           }
           return max;
       
       
    }
    
}
